# Problem 1

## Dataset Description

``` r
data(instacart)
```

The `instacart` dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, and each
row represents an item from an order. The variables include order id,
product id, product name, number identifier of the item in the order,
whether the item is a reorder, and user id. There is also information on
the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior order,
location of the aisle and department with their corresponding id. In
total, there are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from 131209
distinct users.

## Aisle Overview

  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))

    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles in total. Most items are ordered from fresh
vegetables and fresh fruits aisles.

## Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle

## Plot: Age Distribution by Education Level

``` r
accel_obs_df |> 
  group_by(sex) |> 
  count(education) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

| sex    | education              |   n |
|:-------|:-----------------------|----:|
| male   | Less than high school  |  27 |
| male   | High school equivalent |  35 |
| male   | More than high school  |  56 |
| female | Less than high school  |  28 |
| female | High school equivalent |  23 |
| female | More than high school  |  59 |

``` r
accel_obs_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~sex+education) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Education among Male and Female") 
```

![](p8105_hw3_yz4720_files/figure-gfm/age%20distribution-1.png)<!-- -->

Among male, 27 have less than high school education, 35 have high school
equivalent education, and 56 have more than high school education. Among
female, 28 have less than high school education, 23 have high school
equivalent education, and 59 have more than high school education. It is
obvious that higher proportion of participants went to beyond high
school.

From the age distribution plots by education level, we can see that
younger participants (aged 21 - 40) tend to have higher education levels
and went beyond high school. Mid-aged (aged 40 - 60) tend to have high
school equivalent education. Older particpants (aged 60+) tend to have
less than high school education.

## Plot: Total Activity Distribution by Education Level

``` r

![](p8105_hw3_yz4720_files/figure-gfm/age%20and%20activity%20sum-1.png)<!-- -->

Comparing across male and female, it seems like female tend to have
higher total activity compared to male. For more educated participants,
their total activity is more stable as they age compared to those who
are less educated. In general, total activity decreases as age
increases.

## Plot: 24-Hour Activity by Education Level

``` r

    names_to = "min",

  mutate(min = as.numeric(min)) |> 
  mutate(hour = floor((min-1)/60))|> 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = data_value, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~education)

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

![](p8105_hw3_yz4720_files/figure-gfm/hourly%20activity%20by%20sex-1.png)<!-- -->

Activity increases during the day from around hour 6 and reaches its
maximum at around hour 9. Activity remains relatively stable until hour
20 and starts to decrease. The minimum activity is reached around hour
4. When comparing hourly activity among male and female, female tend to
have slightly higher activity than male.
